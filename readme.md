# Reading distance from the Benewake TFmini LIDAR Module via I2C in Python

This repository is aiming only at the TFmini I2C LIDAR module. As of 2020-05-05, no Python implementation for reading the sensor module was available. There are several very similar TFmini modules available, including the TFmini plus (can be switched between serial/I2C mode), and the 'regular' TFmini (serial only). The script in this library is inteded for the TFmini I2C, as sold for example by DigiKey (https://www.digikey.com/products/en/sensors-transducers/optical-sensors-distance-measuring/542?k=tfmini&k=&pkeyword=tfmini&sv=0&pv41=356919&sf=0&quantity=&ColumnSort=0&page=1&pageSize=25), SparkFun (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14786) Robotshop (https://www.robotshop.com/en/benewake-tfmini-micro-lidar-module-i2c-12-m.html).
